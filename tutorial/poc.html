        <h2>Proof of Concept (Part of the Tutorial Proposal)</h2>
        <p>
            On this page, you will provide a model or prototype 
            to help explain the reusable component you want to build. 
         
        </p>
        <p>
            You can have hard coded HTML tags with ids if you need them to 
            show event handling. Your JS code can have global variables. 
            It's just a model, not final reusable code).
